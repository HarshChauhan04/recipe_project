How to Make Paneer Bhatura<br>
1.
Take all purpose flour, salt, semolina, curd, baking soda and baking powder in a vessel and mix all the ingredients well.<br>
2.
Knead a soft dough with lukewarm water and grease it with oil. Now cover it with a wet cloth and keep it aside for one to one and a half hour.<br>
For the stuffing:<br>
1.
Take grated paneer in a bowl. Add little red chilli, cumin powder, salt and green coriander to it and mix.<br>
2.
Add little flour and mix it, this will dry up the water of the paneer and become dry.<br>
3.
Now make dough balls. You have to prepare one big and small roti by rolling it here.<br>
4.
Place the prepared stuffing on the big roti, place a small puri on it and lift it from all sides to make a dough again and remove the extra dough. Similarly prepare all the bhaturas.<br>
5.
Heat oil in a pan and fry all the bhaturas till they turn crispy and golden in color.<br>
6.
Enjoy by pairing it with chole and lachha onion.<br>
