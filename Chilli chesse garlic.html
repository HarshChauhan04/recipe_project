        How to Make Chilli Cheese Garlic Paratha<br>
        1.
        In a mixing bowl, combine the wheat flour and a pinch of salt.<br>
        2.
        Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a soft, pliable dough.<br>
        3.
        Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.<br>
        4.
        In a separate bowl, combine the grated cheese, finely chopped green chillies, minced or grated garlic, a pinch of salt, and spices.<br>
        5.
        Flatten the ball slightly and dust it with a little dry wheat flour. Roll out the dough into a small disc.<br>
        6.
        Place a spoonful of the prepared filling in the centre of the rolled-out dough.<br>
        7.
        Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling, enclosing it completely.<br>
        8.
        Gently roll out the stuffed dough ball into a flat, round paratha.<br>
        9.
        Heat a pan or griddle over medium heat and add a little ghee or oil.<br>
        10.
        Once the pan is hot, carefully place the rolled-out paratha on it.<br>
        11.
        Cook until the bottom side turns golden brown.<br>
        12.
        Flip the paratha and cook the other side until it's golden brown and crispy.<br>
        13.
        Ensure that the cheese inside the paratha melts and becomes gooey.<br>
        14.
        Serve hot.<br>
